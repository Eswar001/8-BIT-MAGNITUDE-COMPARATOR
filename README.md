# 8-BIT-MAGNITUDE-COMPARATOR
Comparators are a basic design module and element in modern digital VLSI design, digital signal processors and data processing application-specific integrated circuits. In many applications there is a growing demand for the development of low voltage and low power circuits and systems. Low power consumption is of great interest because it increases the battery lifetime. One of the main building blocks in many applications is the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) which serves as an interface between the analogue world and the digital processing unit. In all these designs the comparator of the ADC, which is one the most power-hungry blocks, is always on. In order to reduce the power consumption of the ADC it is possible to turn the comparator off when the decision is made, and the comparator is not needed until the next clock cycle. Especially, this work focuses on the reduction of the power dissipation, which is showing an ever-increasing growth with the scaling down of the technologies. Various techniques at the different levels of the design process have been implemented to reduce the power dissipation at the circuit, architectural and system level.
